### Frontend Task: Spy Cats Dashboard (Next.js)

In addition to the backend, you are required to build a simple frontend using **Next.js**. The goal is to create a small, focused dashboard that allows Spy Cat Agency (SCA) agents to manage spy cats more easily.

**Requirements:**

- Build a **Spy Cats Management Page** that includes:
    - A **list of all spy cats** (retrieved from your backend API).
    - A **form to add a new spy cat** (Name, Years of Experience, Breed, Salary).
    - An **edit option** to update a cat’s Salary.
    - A **delete option** to remove a spy cat.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Use Next.js
- You may use any component library or TailwindCSS for UI.
- Ensure the app handles API errors gracefully (e.g., shows an error message if the backend validation fails).
- The focus is on **clean, functional UI and clear API integration**—styling can be minimal.

**Note:** You are not required to implement the full Missions/Targets flow on the frontend for this assessment; the focus is solely on the **Spy Cats** CRUD functionality.
